            The tawny owl (also called the brown owl) (Strix aluco) is commonly found in woodlands across much of Eurasia and North Africa, and has 11 recognized subspecies. 
            It is a stocky, medium-sized owl, whose underparts are pale with dark streaks, and whose upper body may be either brown or grey. (In several subspecies, individuals 
            may be of either color). <br>
            The tawny owl typically makes its nest in a tree hole where it can protect its eggs and young against potential predators. It is non-migratory and highly territorial: as a 
            result, when young birds grow up and leave the parental nest, if they cannot find a vacant territory to claim as their own, they will often starve. <br>

            The tawny owl is a nocturnal bird of prey. It is able to hunt successfully at night because of its vision and hearing adaptations and its ability to fly 
            silently. It usually hunts by dropping suddenly from a perch and seizing its prey, which it swallows whole. It hunts mainly rodents, although in urbanized areas 
            its diet includes a higher proportion of birds. It also sometimes catches smaller owls, and is itself sometimes hunted by the eagle owl and the northern goshawk.
