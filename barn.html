                The barn owl (Tyto alba) is the most widely distributed species of owl in the world and one of the most widespread of all 
                species of birds, being found almost everywhere in the world except for the polar and desert regions, Asia north of the 
                Himalayas, most of Indonesia, and some Pacific Islands. It is also known as the common barn owl, to distinguish it from the 
                other species in its family, 
                Tytonidae, which forms one of the two main lineages of living owls, the other being the typical owls (Strigidae). <br>
                There are at least three major lineages of barn owl: the western barn owl of Europe, western Asia, and Africa; the eastern 
                barn owl of southeastern Asia and Australasia; and the American barn owl of the Americas. Some taxonomic authorities classify 
                barn owls differently, recognising up to five separate species; and further research needs to be done to resolve the disparate
                taxonomies. There is considerable variation of size and colour among the approximately 28 subspecies, but most are between 33 
                and 39 cm (13 and 15 in) in length, with wingspans ranging from 80 to 95 cm (31 to 37 in). The plumage on the head and back is 
                a mottled shade of grey or brown; that on the underparts varies from white to brown and is sometimes speckled with dark 
                markings. The face is characteristically 
                heart-shaped and is white in most subspecies. This owl does not hoot, but utters an eerie, drawn-out screech. </article>
