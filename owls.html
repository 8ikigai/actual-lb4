                        Owls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands.
                        Owls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn-owl family, Tytonidae.
